# SSOEVE
An exercise for working with  SSO

This is a simple proof of concept for working with SSO. The authentication and token refresh was easy enough to handle but, I found the EVE api is something if a trainwreck to work with requiring a multitude of api calls to get the desired information. Turns out this is pretty well known among third party developers for EVE online.
